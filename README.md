cfjs 1.2.7
====

A project that replicates 89 ColdFusion functions using JavaScript/jQuery

Is there a function missing that you wish were included in CFJS? 

Ask me to add it.

Or better yet, add it yourself, and then send me a pull reqeust so I can include it here. I really appreciate it when people will not only suggest changes, but actually offer solutions as well. Don't want to fork the project and go through all that? You can simply email me. I don't mind.



Cheers!
Chris
