cfjs 1.2.7

A project that replicates _**89**_ ColdFusion functions using JavaScript/jQuery. It is dual licensed under the [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licenses.

Is there a function missing that you wish were included in CFJS? 

[Ask me to add it.](mailto:chris.s.jordan@gmail.com?subject=CFJS Change Request)

Or better yet, add it yourself, and then send me a pull reqeust so I can include it here. I really appreciate it when people will not only suggest changes, but actually offer solutions as well. 

Don't want to fork the project and go through all that? You can simply [email me](mailto:chris.s.jordan@gmail.com?subject=CFJS Change Request). I don't mind.

Cheers!
Chris
